## Introduction

HarmonicAI is a revolutionary vocal processing VST plugin designed to fundamentally transform any vocal input into professional-grade, pitch-perfect performances. Unlike traditional pitch correction tools like Autotune which simply shift pitch values, HarmonicAI employs advanced deep learning algorithms and sophisticated digital signal processing to completely reconstruct vocal performances while maintaining the natural characteristics of the singer's voice.

This plugin represents a paradigm shift in vocal processing technology. While conventional pitch correction software focuses on moving notes to the nearest semitone, HarmonicAI analyzes the entire harmonic structure of a vocal, the characteristic formant profile of the singer, and the emotional qualities of the performance to create a perfectly tuned vocal that maintains the expressiveness and unique character of the original.

Whether you're a professional recording engineer, a music producer working with vocalists of varying skill levels, or an individual artist looking to perfect your own vocals, HarmonicAI provides unparalleled vocal enhancement that makes traditional autotune technology obsolete.

## Key Features

- **Revolutionary Neural Vocal Analysis**: Proprietary deep learning models identify pitch, formants, harmonic content, and expressive qualities with unprecedented accuracy.

- **Zero-Latency Processing**: Advanced predictive algorithms deliver real-time processing with imperceptible latency (as low as 3ms), making it suitable for live performances.

- **Intelligent Harmony Generation**: Automatically creates realistic harmonies based on the musical context and chord progressions of your track.

- **Formant Preservation and Enhancement**: Unlike traditional pitch correction that creates "chipmunk effects" at higher pitches, HarmonicAI maintains natural vocal timbre across all pitch adjustments.

- **Voice Character Modeling**: Capture and apply the vocal characteristics of different singing styles and timbres, allowing unlimited vocal transformation possibilities.

- **Micro-Expression Retention**: Preserves subtle vocal techniques like vibrato, slides, and articulations while correcting pitch inaccuracies.

- **Advanced De-Essing and Breath Control**: Integrated tools for managing sibilance and breath sounds without additional plugins.

- **Multi-voice Capabilities**: Process multiple vocal tracks simultaneously with intelligent part separation and ensemble management.

- **Adaptive Tuning System**: Beyond simple scale-based correction, the plugin analyzes harmonic context to make musically intelligent pitch decisions.

- **GPU Acceleration**: Leverages GPU processing for complex neural network calculations when available.

- **Expandable Voice Database**: Regular updates provide new voice models and transformation capabilities.

   - Verify plugin is not blacklisted in your DAW
   - Try manually copying plugin to DAW-specific plugin folder

2. **High CPU Usage**:
   - Reduce buffer size in the plugin settings
   - Switch to Real-time mode instead of Quality mode
   - Disable unused modules in the plugin
   - Reduce polyphony settings if using harmony features
   - Consider freezing or bouncing tracks after processing

3. **Unexpected Audio Artifacts**:
   - Check for clipping in the input signal
   - Adjust the Input Gain in the plugin
   - Verify correct sample rate in both DAW and plugin
   - Try increasing buffer size for more stable processing
   - Ensure sufficient headroom in the vocal recording

4. **Latency Issues**:
   - Use Low Latency mode for tracking
   - Check DAW buffer size settings
   - Verify plugin delay compensation is enabled in your DAW
   - Use direct monitoring through audio interface when recording
   - Consider offline rendering for complex processing

5. **Pitch Correction Problems**:
   - Verify correct key and scale settings
   - Adjust Detection Sensitivity for the specific vocal
   - Check if input contains excessive noise or artifacts
   - Use the Waveform Display to identify problem areas
   - Try different Correction Algorithms for the specific voice

### Diagnostic Tools

1. **Built-in Analysis**:
   - Use the System Information panel to view current resources
   - Run the Audio Path Test to verify signal integrity
   - Check Plugin Performance metrics in the diagnostics view
   - View detailed processing statistics in the Advanced panel
   - Export diagnostic reports for technical support

2. **Log Files**:
   - Access log files in the following locations:
     - Windows: C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\HarmonicAI\Logs
     - macOS: ~/Library/Logs/HarmonicAI
   - Enable Verbose Logging for more detailed information
   - Check for warning or error messages in the logs
   - Verify correct plugin initialization sequence
   - Monitor resource allocation and deallocation

3. **External Verification**:
   - Use your DAW's CPU meter to monitor performance
   - Try the plugin in a different DAW to isolate issues
   - Test with simple project to eliminate interference from other plugins
   - Verify audio driver settings and performance
   - Check system resource monitoring tools during operation
